# Predicting injuries in football based on data collected from GPS-based wearable sensors 


Our research aims to develop methods to predict the risk of non-contact injuries in elite male footballers. The preparation of such a model will enable the construction of a tool that can monitor individual players’ training and match loads on an ongoing basis and adjusts micro-training cycles to minimize the risk of injury. The motor preparation team will receive an ongoing report on the level of injury risk. Based on existing research, we know that both high loads and under-training significantly increase the risk of injury. In addition, changes in training load from microcycle to microcycle are very important in this case and are an additional risk factor. The research is carried out together with the science department of the KKS Lech Poznań football club.
